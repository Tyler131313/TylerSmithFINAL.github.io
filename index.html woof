      <h2 align="center">&quot;Angel&quot; -- Gorgeous rare mahogany bay tobiano 5-1/2 year old Tennessee Walking Horse mare, bred, raised and trained right here on our farm. (We also raised both her parents!) Angel loves people and pretty much comes in from the pasture, puts her head in the halter to be led back to the barn. She has been camping at the lake, as well as the ocean and also to Falling Waters in Arkansas for a week. Angel has never known any kind of abuse or neglect, and consequently she is very trusting. She has had one foal, a beautiful black minimal tobiano colt that is also for sale. We believe Angel is homozygous for tobiano gene, as both her parents were spotted and her first foal is spotted, even though the sire is solid. This can be confirmed with a $40 DNA test. Angel has a beautiful racking gait that floats across the ground, but her canter is really spectacular, automatic and easy. She floats up into the easiest rocking chair canter and understands her lead commands. Angel also sidepasses, pivots, forehand turns, backs, loads easily, stands tied for hours, and probably most riders would feel pretty comfortable on her. She is registered with TWHBEA, current on her vaccinations, worming and negative coggins. $6850 Click on her photo to see videos and photos.</h2>

He is Jackpot's 'uncle', born out of Jackpot's granddam, Kitty. This is going to be one sane, gentle, family-type horse that will be rugged enough for the biggest man, and gentle enough for the youngsters in the family. His markings are so flashy and beautiful, and I particularly love his big bone structure. He will have a beautiful smooth gait with a slow, rocking chair canter. JW already knows how to pick up his feet for hoof cleaning, load in a trailer, walk over obstacles on the obstacle course, be ponied by another horse, be ponied by a 4-wheeler, stand tied while tractors haul round bales by and move dirt, and he has had several baths in his life. He has grown up with cattle, goats, a pig, other horses in a natural environment, crossing creeks and traveling through muddy areas at will. I have hauled him to the vet when I take other horses, just to give him the experience. He is weaned and ready for his new home, and his price includes TWHBEA registration, vaccinations, and negative coggins. $2500</h2>

Farley has a beautiful compact, sturdy build with wonderfully hard, healthy hooves, a sloping shoulder, a round hindquarters and a gorgeous tiny head. He has never been sick or injured, and we have camped and ridden him in Texas, Colorado, Mississippi in the forests, the lakes and at the Gulf of Mexiico in the ocean. Farley will slow walk like a Quarter Horse, and you can squeeze your legs and ask him to gait, and he will float up into the easiest four-beat rack. He will coast along at normal gaited horse speeds (6 or 7 mph) or you can really crank him up to about 16 or 17 mph, with the potential to get even faster with daily workouts toward that goal. He actually has a wonderful, smooth canter but we don't let him do it often in an effort to increase his racking speed. Farley had all of his vaccinations (VEWT, Flu/Rhino, West Nile) on 9/8/19, and he is currently barefoot. He has only been shod twice in his life, when we camped in rocky areas, including the Colorado Rocky Mountains. $7500</h2>

She has had two beautiful colts, the first which is a gorgeous bay, and the second is on her side now, a beautifully marked robust bay and white colt. Kitty was put through our training program when she was started under saddle and is trained to back, side pass, pivot, forehand turn, move off leg pressure, step over logs to be mounted in the woods,ride by highway traffic, tractors, 4 wheelers, cattle, chickens, turkeys, goats, and will stall or pasture, but has spent much of her life in the pasture. She rides beautifully smooth with no trick to shoeing -- she has spent most of her life barefoot and performs a super smooth four beat racking gait, as well as a smooth canter, barefoot. Delightfully athletic, she'd make a great mountain horse. She is for sale in a 2-for-1 package with her TWHBEA spotted colt for $6500 for the pair.</strong></h2>

This mare is just about the prettiest horse anywhere we go, with so much natural presence and pride. A fairy tale beautiful, nice bucket list kind of horse. $12,500</h2></td>

Probably anyone of any age can drive this guy -- he's very willing and not spoiled, as you can see in his video. This is one that will teach you how to drive. He is also a pretty good lawnmower -- we turn him loose in the front yard or stake him out in different places in the yard to 'weed eat'. Cutest little leather harness with brass accent and knobs on the hames comes with him, as does his cart. The kids drive him, even kids who have never driven a horse before, and he is so gentle and well behaved that we used him to visit the elderly at the nursing home. In the parades that we put him in, he was a huge crowd favorite. We are busy raising colts and training, and don't have time to enjoy him as much as we'd like, so it's time for him to go to a family who will love him as much as we have. $2750</h2>

      <h1 align="center"><em>***SOLD*** Congratulations, Kathi!</em></h1>
      <h2 align="center">&quot;Sam&quot; -- Gorgeous, stocky like a Quarter Horse, huge, round rump, big wide chest, sloping shoulder, big bone structure, between 15.1 and 15.2H (but not over 15.2H), dapples in his coat, dark golden color even in the winter . . . and as a bonus, probably anyone would feel safe riding him. He performs a fun smooth racking gait with white tail streaming out behind him, and if something scares him, he spooks in place. He comes from top bloodlines in the breed and is a perfect age at 10-1/2 years old. He has been barefoot for almost all of his life and has excellent rock hard hooves of steel. We did put front shoes on him only to get him ready to take to the mountains.  Sidepasses, pivots, forehand turns and is doing really great on the obstacle course. Very sweet, people loving, trusting gelding with a willing heart. Great family horse, great forever horse. This is the horse that you can put your whole family on and friends who drive up. Sam is only available for purchase because of his owner's family's health problems and having to dedicate time to being a caretaker. $12,000</h2>

      <h2 align="center">&quot;Sophie&quot; -- Classy, Drop Dead Gorgeous Black &amp; White Spotted Tennessee Walking Horse with top bloodlines. Perfect age (7 years old), great size (15.2H).  We raised her! We trained her, and we've hauled her across the nation, camping in Texas, Colorado, Montana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, etc., ridden her in parades, won in horse shows with her, and won at obstacle competitions with her. She has a fabulous head shaking Tennessee Walk, and will also sit up in the bridle and perform a thrilling racking gait. Her canter is the dreamiest rocking chair canter you've ever ridden. She side passes, pivots, forehand turns, backs, and most anyone would feel comforable riding her. She has miles and miles on her odometer yet is a relatively young horse (7 years old) with a lifetime to offer a family or person. We bred her to our stallion and she had a gorgeous filly, which we knew would be spotted because she is homozygous for tobiano, and we look forward to raising and developing her filly (Salsa) to be a great horse like her gorgeous mama! $9500**SOLD**</h2>

<p align="center"><i><b>I have found, through this website, that there are so 
  many wonderful, sympathetic people in the world and many of you have been 
  through situations like mine (nursing a loved one with a terminal illness). 
  Cancer is a terrible thing, and the only thing I can think of worse is war. 
  Thank you all for sharing your stories with me and for your support and 
  encouragement. You probably have no idea how much you've all helped with the 
  time you took to email, even those of you not inquiring about a horse. Life is 
  short, even for healthy people, so LIVE IT UP!&nbsp; Bless all 
  of you!&nbsp; Click <font color="#FF0000"> <a href="http://www.cloud9walkers.com/Cancer.htm">HERE</a></font> for info,
